# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Fixed!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Removed Jekyll Workflow** - Deleted the incompatible Jekyll workflow
2. **Added Vite Deployment Workflow** - Created proper GitHub Actions for React/Vite
3. **Updated Base Path** - Changed `base: './'` to `base: '/muhilanportfolio/'` in vite.config.js

## 📋 GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/Anjai7/muhilanportfolio
2. Click **Settings** (top right)
3. Click **Pages** (left sidebar)
4. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions"
   - (If you see "Deploy from a branch", click dropdown and select "GitHub Actions")
5. Save

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment
1. Go to **Actions** tab: https://github.com/Anjai7/muhilanportfolio/actions
2. You should see "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow running
3. Wait for it to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)
4. Once complete, you'll see a green checkmark ✅

### Step 3: Access Your Site
Your portfolio will be live at:
**https://anjai7.github.io/muhilanportfolio/**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If the workflow doesn't start automatically:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click "Deploy to GitHub Pages" on the left
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Select main branch
5. Click green "Run workflow" button

### If you get a 404 error:
1. Make sure GitHub Pages is set to "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
2. Check that the workflow completed successfully (green checkmark in Actions tab)
3. Wait a few more minutes - sometimes it takes time to propagate

### If assets don't load:
- The base path is now set to `/muhilanportfolio/`
- This is correct for GitHub Pages deployment
- Local dev will still work with `npm run dev`
